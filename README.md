## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for future improvements and features that can be added to this project:

- **Name of State:** In each of the result, the names of the State comes only when hover over that respective points, but if the name of top and bottom performing state renders automatically without manually hovering that point, it would make analysis much easier.

We welcome contributions and ideas from the community. If you have suggestions or would like to work on any of these improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
